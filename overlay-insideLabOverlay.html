<h3>Quantum Sensing Lab</h3>
<p>
                            Our quantum sensing facility hosts NV center diamond setups, 
                            Rydberg atom chambers, and optically pumped magnetometer systems. 
                            Precision optical tables with vibration isolation provide the 
                            stability needed for detecting ultra-weak magnetic and electric fields.
                        </p>

<h3>Atomic Magnetometer Station</h3>
<p>
                            Dedicated to brain signal measurement research, this station 
                            houses alkali vapor cells, laser systems for optical pumping, 
                            and magnetically shielded environments. We develop OPM sensors 
                            for non-invasive magnetoencephalography applications.

<h3>Quantum Computing Access</h3>
<p>
                            We have access to both D-Wave quantum annealing systems and 
                            the IQM Spark gate-based quantum computer. Our researchers 
                            develop and test quantum algorithms remotely, bridging 
                            theoretical design with real hardware execution.

<h3>Precision Optics Workshop</h3>
<p>
                            Our optics workshop features 5-axis mirror alignment systems 
                            and custom automation setups. This facility trains students 
                            in precision instrumentation skills applicable to both 
                            quantum research and industrial optical systems.

<h3>Electronics &amp; Control</h3>
<p>
                            Custom electronics development for quantum experiments, including 
                            photodetector circuits, RF signal processing, laser controllers, 
                            and data acquisition systems. We design the specialized hardware 
                            that enables our sensing and measurement research.

<h3>Daily Life</h3>
<p>
                            Research at QMET spans from algorithm development on quantum 
                            computers to hands-on sensor construction and characterization. 
                            Weekly group meetings foster collaboration across our diverse 
                            research areas, preparing students for careers in both 
                            academia and industry.
